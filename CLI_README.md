WhatExecLite makes use of .NET Trimming and NativeAOT.

### Installation Instructions

- Provide step-by-step instructions to install `whatexec-lite`.

### Usage Examples
**NOTE** Regardless of the number of commands passed as arguments, each resolved command has its file path printed to a new line in Standard Output.

WhatExecLite's assembly/binary name is ``whatexec-lite``. It accepts commands as it's 1st positional argument. The order of other options/arguments should not matter. 

#### Single Command
To resolve the file path of the .NET SDK CLI enter:
```bash
whatexec-lite dotnet
```

The output for this on a Linux based system is typically:
```
/usr/bin/dotnet
```

#### Multiple Commands
To resolve multiple file paths at once, add the space separated list of commands.

For example, to look for dotnet, git, and wc you'd enter
```bash
whatexec-lite dotnet git wc
```

The output or this on a Linux based system is typically:
```
/usr/bin/dotnet
/usr/bin/git
/usr/bin/wc
```

#### Help
To access the WhatExecLite CLI help screen enter:
```bash
whatexec-lite --help
```
